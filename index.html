            <h2>What is this page?</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Grant Cloyd, and this is a final project for pre-work in advance of attending a coding
                bootcamp. I will
                be attending <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School's</a> software engineeering course
                with their Washington, DC.
                cohort from May-August of 2021. As this is the first page I've built from scratch, I am sure it will
                be riddled with problems
                that will make me cringe at a later time. Here's to learning!</p>

            <h2>Work Background</h2>
            <div id="hideWork">
                <p>I studied Theatre, Film, and Media Studies at St. Mary's College of Maryland and started my
                    professional
                    life as an actor. Beyond my undergraduate work, I receieved a graduate degree from Catholic
                    University
                    of America for Acting, and worked professionally around the DC theater scene for over a decade. My
                    work
                    included
                    touring one person shows and even taking a two person show to Edinburgh as part of it's
                    international
                    fringe
                    festival.</p>
                <p>In addition to stage work, I spent a lot of time working as a standardized patient (often referred to
                    as
                    an SP) - someone
                    who is
                    trained to portray a patient coming in with
                    a medical concern to help teach medical students history taking, physical exam, and communication
                    skills before they enter clinical settings. In 2015 I took a job as a full time trainer at a
                    military
                    medical school
                    and stopped performing as an SP and started training them. This eventually led to me being recruited
                    to
                    help open an SP program for a new medical school in Fort Worth, Texas as the Associate Director of
                    SP
                    Education. While working at the school, I also began studying for a second master's degree and was
                    halfway
                    through an Education in Curriculum Studies program when I realized I needed to change careers and
                    change
                    course because I realized that this
                    was not what I wanted to do be doing anymore.
                </p>
                <p> While working at the medical school I became more heavily involved in the technical and
                    logistical components of simulation which, in turn, led to more interest in technology and
                    ultimately
                    being bitten
                    by the coding bug. The power of automation, connection, and innovation that coding can provide is
                    truly
                    amazing and I wish that I had tried it sooner. I am beyond excited to
                    switch into this new field and can't wait to get started at Flatiron!</p>

            <h2>Personal Background</h2>

            <p> I was born in Buffalo, NY but spent much of my life around the DMV area having lived in Virgina, DC,
                or Maryland for over twenty years. I currently live in Fort Worth, TX and have been here since 2018. I
                live with my
                wife, Ann, who is a young adult horror author, and our two cats, Ollie and Sophie.</p>

            <div id="hideLearn">
                <h4>4.16.2021</h4>
                <p>So because this is my first webpage, I figure this section might be a good
                    place to explain some of the things that I'm learning while putting this together. </p>
                <p> One of the first little quirks I ran into was while working with CSS to style the buttons. In this
                    case,
                    the
                    buttons included the series at top of the page (Work, Personal, Etc), and the image buttons in the
                    contact
                    section on the bottom.</p>
                <p>Part of what I was hoping to achieve was a certain amount of consistency in the hover effect, while
                    needing
                    to have different
                    measures such as height and width maintained. So, my thought was to add the class of buttons to the
                    profile
                    images, which led to some interesting side effects. </p>
                <p> As this this is the first time I've tried using multiple classes on a single HTML element, I was
                    able to
                    see the way that the cascade components are 'read' by the browser very quickly. As I had placed my
                    images tag above my buttons tag, my image quickly shifted into square buttons due to the padding and
                    spacing change. They
                    were no longer affected by my border-radius which turned them into a circle and were instead sqaure
                    images with a fair amount of padding.
                </p>
                <p> I admit, I came to somewhat like the clearly broken style while I was working on other components.
                    It
                    certainly didn't
                    look professional, but the consistency of the hover effects were pretty nice. It wasn't until later
                    that
                    the obvious solution to the problem occurred to me: put the images class below the button class and
                    you
                    can solve your
                    problem as the cascade over-writes itself as it moves through the document. Immediately, I could
                    have
                    the styling for both sets of buttons and the same hover effect.</p>
                <h4>4.25.2021</h4>
                <p>While working on the JavaScript functionality of this page, one data structure that I have leaned
                    heavily on for all three of my projects
                    has been arrays. The ability to feed information into a function behind the scenes is truly
                    invaluable and something that I had not grasped fully while simply studying and learning to code by
                    playing around
                    with
                    basic funcionality. This has given me a small taste of
                    what it means when something is scalable.
                </p>
                <p> In the case of the calculator, I built a function which creates and appends all of the buttons by
                    accessing the
                    indices of an array
                    and then assigns them object keys and values based on the expected functionality. While the
                    makeCalc
                    function took awhile to build (and it desperately needs to be broken up into
                    smaller pieces for legibility and easier code maintenence), building it in this way allowed me to
                    simply add two operators as strings (the
                    exponent and modulo/remainder) to the array. With no additional code beyond that, including the
                    function itself,
                    they were immediately
                    working and appended
                    to the appropriate location. Similarly, after adding the decimal point to the array, it required
                    only a single OR operator
                    to be added to an if statement before it too was fully operational </p>
                <p>While that was the most powerful example of array functionality and scaling I cam across, I also
                    rediscovered it
                    in
                    smaller ways in the <a href="./todo.html">To-Do List</a> and the Shakespeare Insult Generator. In
                    the case of the To-Do list, an array enables the 'success statements' to fire when an item is
                    clicked. For the insult generator, it's an easy numbers game: three arrays, two functions, and one
                    event listener allow for
                    125,000 possible insults with very minimal code. In
                    both cases, simply
                    adding to the arrays and in no way touching any other text in the .js or .html files could expand
                    the number of
                    statements that could be generated and displayed to a user with a few keystrokes and git commands.
                    Ultimately, I
                    look forward to discovering the many ways that arrays are able to make functions scalable and
                    adapatable to new features or increased capacities with ease.
