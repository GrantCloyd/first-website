            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Grant Cloyd, and this is a final project for pre-work in advance of attending a coding
                bootcamp, Flatiron School, for
                software engineering. I will
                be part of their DC cohort from May-August of 2021. As such, I am sure it will be riddled with problems
                that will make me cringe at a later time. Here's to learning!</p>

            <h2>Learning Log</h2>
            <h4>4.16.2021</h4>
            <p>So because this is the first webpage that I am building from scratch, I figure this might be a good
                place to explain some of the things that I'm learning while putting this together in anticipation of
                starting with Flatiron. </p>
            <p> One of the first little quirks I ran into was while working with CSS to style the buttons. In this case,
                the
                buttons included the series at top of the page (Work, Personal, Etc), and the image buttons in the
                contact
                section on the bottom.</p>
            <p>Part of what I was hoping to achieve was a certain amount of consistency in the hover effect, while
                needing
                to have different
                measures such as height and width maintained. So, my thought was to add the class of buttons to the
                profile
                images, which led to some interesting side effects. </p>
            <p> As this this is the first time I've tried using multiple classes on a single HTML element, I was able to
                see the way that the cascade components are 'read' by the browser very quickly. As I had placed my
                images tag above my buttons tag, my image quickly shifted into square buttons due to the padding and
                spacing change. They
                were no longer affected by my border-radius which turned them into a circle and were instead sqaure
                images with a fair amount of padding.
            </p>
            <p> I admit, I came to somewhat like the style while I was working on other components. It certainly didn't
                look professional, but the consistency of the hover effects were pretty nice. It wasn't until later that
                the simple solution occurred to me: put the images class below the button class and you can solve your
                problem as the cascade over-writes itself as it moves through the document. Immediately, I could have
                the styling for both sets of buttons and the same hover effect.</p>
