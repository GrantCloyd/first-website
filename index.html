            <h2>What is this page?</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Grant Cloyd, and this is a final project for pre-work in advance of attending a coding
                bootcamp. I will
                be attending <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School's</a> software engineeering course
                with their Washington, DC.
                cohort from May-August of 2021. As this is the first page I've built from scratch, I am sure it will
                be riddled with problems
                that will make me cringe at a later time. Here's to learning!</p>

            <h2>Work Background</h2>
            <p>I studied Theatre, Film, and Media Studies at St. Mary's College of Maryland and started my professional
                life as an actor. Beyond my undergraduate work, I receieved a graduate degree from Catholic University
                of America for Acting, and worked professionally around the DC theater scene for over a decade. My work
                included
                touring one person shows and even taking a production to Edinburgh as part of it's international fringe
                festival.</p>
            <p>In addition to stage work, I spent a lot of time working as a standardized patient (often referred to as
                an SP) - someone
                who is
                trained to portray a patient coming in with
                a medical concern to help teach medical students history taking, physical exam, and communication
                skills. In 2015 I took a job as a full time trainer at a military medical school
                and stopped performing as an SP and started training SPs. This eventually led to me being recruited to
                help open an SP program for a new medical school in Fort Worth as the Associate Director of SP
                Education. While working at the school, I also began studying for a second master's degree and was
                halfway
                through an Education in Curriculum Studies program when I realized I needed to change careers and change
                course because this
                was not what I wanted to do be doing anymore.
            </p>
            <p> While working at the medical school I became more heavily involved in the technical and
                logistical components of simulation which, in turn, led to more interest in technology and ultimately
                being bitten
                by the coding bug. I am beyond excited to
                switch into this new field and can't wait to get started!</p>

            <h2>Personal Background</h2>

            <p> I was born in Buffalo, NY but spent much of my life around the DMV area having lived in Virgina, DC,
                or Maryland for twenty five years. I currently live in Fort Worth, TX after having moved here in 2018. I
                live with my
                wife, Ann, who is a YA horror author, and our two cats, Ollie and Sophie.</p>

            <h2>Learning Log</h2>
            </a>
            <h4>4.16.2021</h4>
            <p>So because this is my first webpage, I figure this section might be a good
                place to explain some of the things that I'm learning while putting this together. </p>
            <p> One of the first little quirks I ran into was while working with CSS to style the buttons. In this case,
                the
                buttons included the series at top of the page (Work, Personal, Etc), and the image buttons in the
                contact
                section on the bottom.</p>
            <p>Part of what I was hoping to achieve was a certain amount of consistency in the hover effect, while
                needing
                to have different
                measures such as height and width maintained. So, my thought was to add the class of buttons to the
                profile
                images, which led to some interesting side effects. </p>
            <p> As this this is the first time I've tried using multiple classes on a single HTML element, I was able to
                see the way that the cascade components are 'read' by the browser very quickly. As I had placed my
                images tag above my buttons tag, my image quickly shifted into square buttons due to the padding and
                spacing change. They
                were no longer affected by my border-radius which turned them into a circle and were instead sqaure
                images with a fair amount of padding.
            </p>
            <p> I admit, I came to somewhat like the clearly broken style while I was working on other components. It
                certainly didn't
                look professional, but the consistency of the hover effects were pretty nice. It wasn't until later that
                the obvious solution to the problem occurred to me: put the images class below the button class and you
                can solve your
                problem as the cascade over-writes itself as it moves through the document. Immediately, I could have
                the styling for both sets of buttons and the same hover effect.</p>

            <p>I'm going to use this space to do something with JavaScript. Something totally sweet (highly unlikely)
